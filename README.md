This data is based off an Adam Finer YouTube video but was created by myself with the help of ChatGPT. 
I wanted to create this dataset as a resource for practicing SQL and data visualization. 
The data is built off a hypothetical 3-fold client criteria:

1. Order log - recording item, quantity, time, and customer details for each order
2. Stock control - tracking inventory stock levels to know when to order more
3. Staff details - logging staff info, general rota, and schedule for the 4 weeks

The file named "pizzeria.ipynb" is where I cleaned the data using SQL notation in a Jupyter Notebook with SQLite.
